The Wordpress Sliding Drawer Plugin instantly adds a jQuery powered Sliding Drawer content area to your site.

== Description ==
The WordPress Sliding Drawer Content Area plugin greatly increases the screen real estate of your wordpress site. The sliding content area is jQuery powered and can be configured to slide from the top, bottom, left or right. Everything in the plugin from the position, color and handle text is customizable and easy to setup.
Once you setup the plugin, you'll have up to four newly created widget areas that can take any content that a widget area can. A couple of great suggestions for the sliding drawer content area from 61 designs is to using it as a feedback/contact form or as a sliding media gallery for flickr/picasa. The sliding drawer plugin has been tested across all major browsers.
